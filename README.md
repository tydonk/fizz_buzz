# Fizz Buzz
A quick and simple Python app to simulate a game of Fizz Buzz.

The game counts up from 1 to any number the user chooses from the CLI. If no number is chosen the game will count to 99. If the number is divisible by 3, the app returns 'fizz'. If the number is divisible by 5, the app returns 'buzz'. Finally if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 then the app returns 'fizz buzz'.

# Install and run
Navigate to your chosen directory and clone repository

`git clone https://github.com/tydonk/fizz_buzz`

From the CLI run `fizz-user-input.py`
